## Benchmarks
Each directory contains all the annotated source files and populated configuration files for example benchmarks. Copy `all the files` and `results directory` from any directory to the root of GPU-Trident to run GPU-Trident with these benchmarks.

`results_completed` directory contains results by running GPU-Trident on these applications.
